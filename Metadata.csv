AspectAster_m,aspect at mound location extracted from the mosaiced JICA ASTER DEM. Numeric values are within 0 -360 degrees representing the cardinal directions of aspect,numeric field
TRI,Terrain Ruggedness Index measures the amount of elevation difference between eight adjacent cells of a DEM according to Wilson et al. (2007). The eight elevation differences are squared and averaged. The square root of this average results is a TRI measurement for the center cell.,numeric field
TPI,Topographic Position Index measures the difference between the value of a cell and the mean value of its 8 surrounding cells. ,numeric field
Roughness,Roughness is the difference between the maximum and the minimum value of a cell and its 8 surrounding cells.,numeric field
